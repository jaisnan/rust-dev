# Rust std-lib verification contest

This repository is a fork of the official Rust programming language repository, created solely to verify the Rust standard library. It should not be used as an alternative to the official Rust releases.

The goal is to have a contest to help verify the [Rust standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) and prove that it is safe. The contest will contain several challenges that can be solved by participants. These challenges can take on one of many forms such as:


1. Contributing to the core mechanism of verifying the rust standard library
2. Creating new techniques to perform scalable verification
3. Apply techniques to verify previously unverified parts of the standard library.


To help you get started in the contest, Amazonâ€™s [Kani-rust-verifier team](https://github.com/model-checking/kani) has created mechanisms and tools to help participants verify the standard library. The Kani team has also created some initial contracts and proofs (To be filled and linked here later) to help you get started as a participant.

NOTE: This work is not official, affiliated, or endorsed by the Rust project or Rust Foundation.

## Contest Details

Here are some details for the contest

1. This repository will contain templates for [Issues](https://github.com/model-checking/verify-rust-std/issues), [pull requests](https://github.com/model-checking/verify-rust-std/pulls) etc. that will be used to create new challenges for verifying the Rust standard library.
2. This repository will contain the initial contracts and proofs that AWS creates using Kani as a tool to verify the standard library.
3. Verification of the functions will be enabled using CI pipelines and Kani tool initially.
4. Any new tool that participants want to enable will require an application using an Issue template. This tool will be analyzed by an independent committee consisting of members from the Rust open-source developers and AWS
    1. A new tool application should clearly specify the differences to existing techniques and provide sufficient background of why this is needed.
    2. Once the tool is approved, it needs to be enabled using CI pipelines.
5. Each contribution or attempt should be submitted via a pull request that will be analyzed by the committee.
6. Each contribution will be reviewed on a first come first serve basis. Acceptance will be based on a unanimous affirmative vote from the review committee.
7. The contribution must be automated and should work in CI.
8. Once approved by the review committee, the change will be merged into the repository.

## [Kani](https://github.com/model-checking/kani)

The Kani Rust Verifier is a bit-precise model checker for Rust.

Kani verifies:

* Memory safety (e.g., null pointer dereferences)
* User-specified assertions (i.e `assert!(...)`)
* The absence of panics (eg., `unwrap()` on `None` values)
* The absence of some types of unexpected behavior (e.g., arithmetic overflows).


You can find out more about Kani from the [Kani book](https://model-checking.github.io/kani/) or the [Kani repository on Github](https://github.com/model-checking/kani).
