# Verify Rust Standard Library Contest

The Verify Rust Standard Library contest is an ongoing contest that targets the verification of the [Rust standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/). The goal of this contest is to provide automated verification that can be used to verify that a given Rust standard library implementation is safe.

The contest will contain several challenges that can be solved by participants. These challenges can take on one of many forms such as:

1. Contributing to the core mechanism of verifying the rust standard library
2. Creating new techniques to perform scalable verification
3. Apply techniques to verify previously unverified parts of the standard library.


We encourage everyone to watch this repository to be notified of any changes.

In this book you can find more details about the contest such as: General Rules, Challenges, Verification Tools.
