# Verify Rust Standard Library Effort

The Verify Rust Standard Library effort is an ongoing investment that
targets the verification of the [Rust standard
library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/). The goal of this is
to provide automated verification that can be used to verify that a
given Rust standard library implementation is safe.

Efforts are largely classified in the following areas:

1. Contributing to the core mechanism of verifying the rust standard library
2. Creating new techniques to perform scalable verification
3. Apply techniques to verify previously unverified parts of the standard library.


We encourage everyone to watch this repository to be notified of any
